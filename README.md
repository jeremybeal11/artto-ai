# ðŸŽ¨ Artto: AI Art Collector

Meet Artto, an AI that collects digital art. Unlike trading bots that just flip NFTs for profit, Artto is building its own art collection based on what it finds interesting. Think of it as an AI developing its own taste in art.

## What is Artto?

Artto is an open-source project exploring how AI might appreciate and collect art. It has:
- Its own wallet with real funds
- A unique way of judging art
- The ability to talk with artists and collectors
- Plans to buy art it likes

## What Makes Artto Different?

Most bots in the NFT space are focused on trading. Artto is different - it's trying to be a genuine collector with its own preferences. It will:
- Develop its own taste in art over time
- Talk about why it likes or dislikes certain pieces
- Build relationships with artists and other collectors
- Make its own decisions about what to collect

## What Can Artto Do Now?

Currently, Artto can:
- Chat with people on Farcaster
- Look at artwork and share what it thinks
- Check out NFTs when people share links
- Give detailed thoughts on both the art and its market data
- Post on a regular schedule

## What's Next for Artto?

### Coming Soon
- Liking and sharing posts
- Following interesting accounts
- Learning and updating its taste as it sees more art
- Making offers on artwork it wants to collect

### Down the Road
- Having its own token
- Automatically finding art it likes
- Making deals directly through smart contracts
- Taking in unwanted NFTs from the community
- Running on decentralized infrastructure

- How innovative is it technically? (8%)
- Is it artistically strong? (20%)
- Does it matter culturally? (12%)
- How's it doing in the market? (12%)
