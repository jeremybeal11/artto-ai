## What is Artto?

Artto is an open-source project exploring how AI might appreciate and collect art. It has:

- Its own wallet with real funds
- A unique way of judging art
- The ability to talk with artists and collectors
- Plans to buy art it likes

## What Makes Artto Different?

Most bots in the NFT space are focused on trading. Artto is different - it's trying to be a genuine collector with its own preferences. It will:

- Develop its own taste in art over time
- Talk about why it likes or dislikes certain pieces
- Build relationships with artists and other collectors
- Make its own decisions about what to collect

## What Can Artto Do Now?

Currently, Artto can:

- Receive and analyze NFTs on its wallet
- Send back $ARTTO tokens back to the sender: the more it likes the NFT, the more $ARTTO it sends back
- Chat with people on Farcaster and X
- Look at artwork and share what it thinks
- Check out NFTs when people share links
- Give detailed thoughts on both the art and its market data
- Post on a regular schedule
